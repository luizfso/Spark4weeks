In FarenheitToCelsius.html, add the same menu that index.html contains.In this menu, add a link back to index.html
In FarenheitToCelsius.html, create a section that will appear to the right of the menu. In this section, display the formula for converting a temperature from degrees Farenheit to degrees Celsius. Additionally, write a little bit of history about the two units, and how each unit is derived (I don't care if you crib from Wikipedia). For example, Celsius is the difference between the freezing point and boiling point of water, divided into 100 units.

Repeat Step 4 for at least 3 more pages, each listing a different conversion. Make sure that every page is accessible from the menu in index.html
Continue to style your pages however you like.
